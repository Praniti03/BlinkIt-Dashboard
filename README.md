📊**BlinkIt Sales Performance Dashboard**

🔍**Overview**

This project focuses on building an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze BlinkIt’s sales performance, customer ratings, and inventory distribution. The goal was to translate business requirements into actionable insights using key performance indicators (KPIs) and data visualizations to support data-driven decision-making.

🧠**Business Problem**

BlinkIt operates across multiple outlets and product categories, making it challenging to track sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory trends at scale. Stakeholders need a consolidated view of key metrics to identify high-performing products, underperforming segments, and opportunities for optimization.

🎯**Objectives**

•	Analyze overall sales performance and customer ratings

•	Evaluate product and outlet-level performance

•	Understand how factors such as fat content, outlet size, and location influence sales

•	Present insights through an interactive and easy-to-use dashboard

📌**Key KPIs**

The dashboard focuses on the following core KPIs:

•	**Total Sales**: Overall revenue generated from all items sold

•	**Average Sales**: Average revenue per transaction

•	**Number of Items**: Total count of items sold

•	**Average Rating**: Average customer rating for items sold

🧹**Data Processing & Modeling**

•	Performed data walkthroughs and connected raw datasets to Power BI

•	Cleaned and validated data to handle inconsistencies and missing values

•	Built a structured data model with relationships between sales, product, and outlet attributes

•	Implemented DAX measures to calculate KPIs dynamically across different dimensions

📈**Analysis & Visualizations**

The dashboard includes multiple visualizations to address business questions:

•	Total Sales by Fat Content (Donut Chart)

•	Total Sales by Item Type (Bar Chart)

•	Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales (Stacked Column Chart)

•	Total Sales by Outlet Establishment Type (Line Chart)

•	Sales by Outlet Size (Donut/Pie Chart)

•	Sales by Outlet Location (Funnel Map)

•	All KPIs by Outlet Type (Matrix View)

Interactive filters and drill-downs allow users to explore trends across item type, fat content, outlet size, location, and establishment type.

💡**Key Insights**

•	Certain product categories and fat content types consistently outperform others

•	Outlet size and location show a strong correlation with sales performance

•	Specific outlet types generate higher average sales and customer ratings

•	Clear opportunities exist for inventory optimization and product assortment planning

🛠️**Tools & Technologies**

•	Power BI (Dashboard development & visualization)

•	DAX (KPI calculations)

•	Data Modeling (Relationships & schema design)

🚀**Outcome**

The final dashboard provides a consolidated, interactive view of sales and customer metrics, enabling effective performance evaluation and supporting data-driven inventory and product assortment decisions.
